**Statera – The smart way to diversify**

***

### 0.1 - Mission

Statera indices enable investors of all levels to access sophisticated investment strategies—automatically managed to maximize returns, without effort and without trusted intermediaries.

Whether you're a beginner or an expert, Statera allows you to invest in diversified indices (e.g., 50% BTC / 50% HYPE), automatically rebalanced.

***

### 0.2 - Vision and Values

The Statera protocol is fully aligned with Hyperliquid’s core values:

- **Performance** → Hourly rebalancing via Hypercore.
- **Decentralization** → The protocol will evolve into fully decentralized governance.
- **Self-custody** → Users manage their funds directly from their wallets.
- **Open innovation** → Statera builds on Hypercore and HyperEVM, two proven, reliable technologies, to deliver novel and relevant solutions.
- **Transparency** → Like Hyperliquid, Statera is entirely open-source.

We chose to build on **HyperEVM and Hypercore** because we believe in uncompromising decentralization—one that sacrifices nothing in performance, user experience, or scalability.

With Statera, **efficiency does not come at the cost of sovereignty.**

Thanks to Hyperliquid’s decentralized order book and high-performance infrastructure, we offer actively managed indices, rebalanced hourly, with **minimal slippage, low fees, and instant execution**—all without ever asking users to give up ownership of their assets. 

The DeFi of tomorrow must be **as fast as an institutional exchange, as free as an open-source protocol.**


***

### 0.3 - The STA Token: Rewarding Alignment

The **STA token** is not just an access or speculative token.
It is Statera’s **alignment currency**—an asset that rewards those who believe in the protocol, participate in it, and contribute to its growth.

Every STA holder is **morally and economically aligned** with Statera’s success.

Whether you use an index, stake your liquid token, or engage with the ecosystem, STA allows you to **capture a share of the value you help create.**

This is not just a token.
It is **proof of commitment**—and a reward for those who choose to build with us.

## 1 - Protocol

### 1a - What is a Statera Index?

A Statera**&#32;Index** is an **automated, diversified crypto portfolio**, designed to simplify on-chain investing.

For example, our first index, gives you 50% exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and 50% to HYPE, Hyperliquid’s native token—without requiring you to buy or manage these assets yourself.

But Statera is far more than just holding tokens for you.

By depositing HYPE, you receive a **liquid token, called an ERA token** representing your share in the index. This token is **tradable, transferable, and usable in other DeFi protocols**—for lending, staking, or yield strategies.

Thanks to **hourly smart rebalancing**, the index stays true to its strategy: it automatically sells appreciated assets to buy those that have dropped—**profiting from volatility, with zero effort from you and outperforming a simple holding strategy.**

You gain the benefits of **active management**, combined with the **full transparency of a decentralized protocol.**

**Returns, peace of mind, and traceability&#32;**— Statera delivers the **smoothest Web3 investing experience.**

🔍 *But how exactly does smart rebalancing work? And why every hour?*

***

### 1b - Smart Rebalancing: The Core Innovation of Statera

Unlike a static basket of assets, a Statera index is powered by **smart contracts** that automatically adjust its composition to maintain its target allocation—e.g., 50% BTC / 50% HYPE.

Holding crypto long-term (spot) has long been a profitable strategy—who wouldn’t dream, in 2025, of shouting back to their 2013 self: “Just buy Bitcoin!”?

But markets have matured. The era of easy gains is over. Institutions have entered the game.

Today, **passive holding is no longer enough. You must act intelligently.**

#### **How It Works**

Cryptocurrencies are volatile. In Statera indices, this leads to weight imbalances:

- When an asset rises, it becomes **overweighted**.
- When another falls, it becomes **underweighted**.

**Smart rebalancing** automatically adjusts the portfolio:
→ The rebalancing smart contract sells part of the appreciated asset 
→ Then buys more of the underperforming one
→ Fees are payed with users funds on this index. 

This ensures consistent exposure to your chosen assets.

Axone indices perform **hourly checks** on their portfolio composition, but rebalancing is **not executed automatically every hour**—it is **triggered only when an asset’s weight deviates significantly from its target**.

The **deviation threshold** required to initiate a rebalance (e.g., ±0.1% for our first strategy) is **not fixed across all indices**—it is **customized based on the index’s strategy, defined by asset volatility and risk profile**.

For example:

- A **low-volatility index** might use a tight threshold (e.g., ±0.1%) to maintain precise exposure.
- A **high-volatility or momentum-focused index** might use a wider threshold (e.g., ±0.5-1%) to avoid over-trading and capture stronger trends.

This dynamic approach ensures that rebalancing occurs **only when meaningful**, reducing unnecessary operations, minimizing costs, and improving net performance. If the portfolio remains within the defined tolerance band after an hourly check, no action is taken—preserving efficiency while maintaining strategic discipline.

By combining **hourly monitoring** with **index-specific thresholds**, Statera delivers a **smarter, more adaptive form of active management**—fully automated, transparent, and optimized for each strategy.

#### **Example: Statera's first index ERA1 (50% BTC / 50% HYPE)**

After a strong rally in Bitcoin, the portfolio’s composition shifts to:

- **BTC: 50.5%**
- **HYPE: 49.5%**

The **target allocation** is 50/50, and the **rebalancing threshold is set at ±0.1%**. Since BTC is now **0.4 percentage points above** its target (well beyond the 0.1% threshold), the **smart rebalancing mechanism is triggered**.

The smart contract automatically:
→ Sells a portion of BTC
→ Buys HYPE
→ Returns the portfolio to **50% BTC / 50% HYPE**

🔁 **Result**: You’ve **sold high and bought low**—without any action on your part. The system only acted because the deviation was significant, ensuring **smart, efficient, and cost-effective rebalancing**.

This mechanism lets you **benefit from volatility** while avoiding unnecessary trades on minor price noise.

### Advantages of Statera’s Smart Rebalancing

A non-rebalanced portfolio drifts with the market: if BTC surges, you become **overexposed to BTC risk**. A correction can lead to massive losses.

Smart rebalancing **maintains stable allocation**, reducing the risk of overconcentration. In volatile or sideways markets, a rebalanced index **often outperforms simple holding.**

Smart rebalancing doesn’t guarantee outperformance in all market conditions. In strong bull runs, selling early may limit maximum gains. But in return, you **reduce risk, diversify intelligently, and capitalize on volatility**—a more **robust long-term approach.**

### Rebalancing in Traditional Finance

Rebalancing is a well-established pillar of portfolio management. Decades of academic research and institutional practice, including studies by **Vanguard, Morningstar** and others, consistently show that regularly returning a portfolio to its target mix improves **risk-adjusted returns**, captures a **"buy low, sell high" effect**, and avoids unwanted risk drift.

On average, annual or threshold-based rebalancing (±5%) delivers a **performance boost of 0.3% to 0.5% per year**, while reducing volatility.

However, these same studies warn against **excessively frequent rebalancing** (monthly or weekly), due to **transaction costs, spreads, and operational friction**. In traditional finance, marginal costs quickly accumulate, eroding net performance. That’s why conventional wisdom recommends moderate frequency: **not too rare to maintain discipline, not too frequent to avoid overtrading.**

### Rebalancing in DeFi

Rebalancing isn’t just a good idea—it’s a **strategy validated by decades of financial analysis.** It improves risk-return profiles, enforces discipline, and harnesses volatility.

In theory, **DeFi should take rebalancing further**: automation, higher frequency, transparency.

Yet in practice, **most DeFi protocols face the same limitation as TradFi: costs.**

On AMM-based DEXs (Automated Market Makers), each rebalancing incurs:

- **High swap fees**
- **Significant slippage**, especially on large amounts
- **Fragmented liquidity**, vulnerable to manipulation

Like TradFi, frequency quickly becomes **a source of friction, not performance.**

The promise of active, frequent rebalancing **remains unfulfilled**—not due to flawed strategy, but **because of infrastructure limits.**

### Statera’s smart rebalancing: optimized execution via Hypercore

✅ **Statera is designed to break through this barrier.**
By leveraging **Hypercore**, Hyperliquid’s on-chain liquidity engine, Statera bypasses these structural frictions.

Thanks to an on-chain **centralized ultra-high-performance order book**, fueled by **institutional-grade liquidity**, Statera achieves:

- **Minimal fees**
- **Near-zero slippage**
- **Instant execution**

🔄 This infrastructure makes **hourly rebalancing economically rational**—turning what was once a cost into a **performance lever.**

Where others are held back by friction, Statera moves forward—powered by the fusion of **proven strategy and cutting-edge technology.**



### 1c - Statera x HyperUnit

A protocol’s performance is only as strong as the **security of its foundations.**

Fast and low-cost rebalancing makes no sense if your assets are built on **fragile layers, risky bridges, or opaque wrapped tokens.**

That’s why Statera is built on **HyperUnit**—Hyperliquid’s integrated tokenization infrastructure—to ensure a seamless, secure, traceable, and non-custodial user experience.

Most DeFi protocols use **"wrapped" tokens** (wBTC, wETH, etc.) to represent assets from other blockchains. With **HyperUnit**, assets like BTC, ETH, and others are **natively available on Hyperliquid** through an on-chain registration and verification system.

HyperUnit eliminates the risks associated with wrapped tokens and the security vulnerabilities that bridges introduce to on-chain ecosystems.

By relying on native asset representation, Axone ensures:

- **Full transparency** of asset backing
- **No dependency on third-party custodians**
- **Reduced attack surface** (no bridge exploits)
- **On-chain verifiability** of reserves

This means users get the full benefits of cross-chain exposure—without compromising on decentralization or security.

With HyperUnit, **your Bitcoin is truly Bitcoin, your Ethereum is truly Ethereum—natively, securely, and transparently on Hyperliquid.**

## 2 - Protocol Mechanics – Revenue Generation

### 2a - Indices : invest in dynamic portfolios, with one click

A Statera**&#32;strategy** is a **diversified portfolio of crypto assets** (e.g., 50% BTC, 50% HYPE) that **automatically rebalances** to maintain its target allocation.

**Key characteristics:**

- The underlying assets and their weightings in the index
- The frequency of smart rebalancing
- The rebalancing threshold (%)

**How to participate:**

1. The user deposits HYPE
2. The smart contract instantly purchases the underlying assets via **Hypercore**, Hyperliquid’s ultra-high-performance execution layer.
3. The user receives a **liquid token** (e.g., ERA1), representing their proportional share in the index.

**Key advantages:**

- No need to manually manage buys or sells
- **Hourly automatic rebalancing** to stay aligned with the target strategy and profit from volatility
- **Low fees** thanks to Hypercore’s deep liquidity
- **Asset security and integrity** guaranteed by HyperUnit
- Liquid tokens are **compatible with other DeFi protocols** (lending, staking, yield strategies, etc.)

**Withdrawing funds:**
At any time, users can **redeem their liquid tokens for their equivalent value in HYPE.**

- Entry and exit fees: **0.5% each** (paid in HYPE)
- Management fees : 0.95% per year

**Pricing of the liquid token:**

- Based on the portfolio’s **Net Asset Value (NAV)**
- Calculated using **on-chain oracles from Hypercore**, ensuring transparency and resistance to manipulation

### 2b - Strategy staking : transform your ERA token in STA rewards

Users can **deposit their liquid tokens into our Strategy Staking vault** to earn rewards in **STA**, Statera’s native token.

**How it works:**

- The user deposits their liquid tokens into the Strategy Staking vault
- There is **no minimum lock-up period** and **no penalties** for withdrawing
- Rewards in **STA are accrued continuously** and can be claimed at any time

**Source of rewards:**

- **100% of the annual 10% inflation** of the AXN token is allocated to the Strategy Staking vaults
- → **Linear reward distribution over time**: 1 month of participation = 1/12 of annual rewards (shared proportionally among vault depositors)

**Incentive to stay:**

- Rewards accumulate continuously while your tokens are staked.

**Real-time dashboard:**
An on-chain dashboard allows users to monitor:

- Accrued rewards
- Their share in the vault

### Real-World Example: Alice invests 25 HYPE in the ERA1 strategy

🔹 **Context**

- Alice deposits **25 HYPE** into the **ERA1 strategy (50% BTC, 50% HYPE)**
- Entry fee: **0.125 HYPE (0.5%)**
- She receives **24.875 ERA1** (representing 24.875 HYPE of portfolio exposure)
- She deposits her **24.875 ERA1 in the Strategy Staking Vault for 12 months**
- She is **one of 100 participants** in the Strategy Staking vault this year
- The protocol issues 1**0% annual inflation** on STA:
- Total supply: **100,000,000 STA** → 10% = 1**0,000,000 STA/year (on first year)**
-**100% is allocated to ERA depositors in the Staking vault** → 1**0,000,000 STA to distribute**

Reward distribution is linear and based on **token × months deposited&#32;**:

| User | Tokens × Months | Share in Vault |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 - Alice | 24.875 × 12 = 298.5 | 298.5 / 20,000 = 1**.49%** |
| 2 - Bob | 15 × 12 = 180 | 180 / 20,000 = 0.9 % |
| 3 - Clara | 10.5 × 6 = 63 | 63 / 20,000 = 0.32% |
| 4 - Dario | 32.3 × 3 = 96.9 | 96.9 / 20,000 = 0.48 % |
| ..... | ..... | ..... |
| 100 - Alex | 225 x 4 = 900 | 900 / 20,000 = 4.5% |
| **Total** | **20,000 token-months** |  |

→ Alice’s share: 1.49 %
→ **STA reward**: 1.49% × 10,000,000 = **149,000 STA**

🔹 **Alice withdraws after 12 months – Revalued index value**
Assumption: the ERA1 price increased by **20% (including management fees)**

- Value of her **24.875 ERA1** before fees:
→ 24.875 × 1.20 = **29.85 HYPE**
- Exit fee: 0.5% × 29.85 = **0.149 HYPE**
- Final amount received:
→ 29.85 – 0.149 = **29.70 HYPE**

📈 **Alice’s Total Gains**

| Component | Value |
| --- | --- |
| 🔹 Initial deposit | 25 HYPE |
| 💹 Index gain (net performance) | +4.70 HYPE (after fees) |
| 🪙 STA rewards | 149,000 STA |
| ✅ **Total return** | **+18.8% in HYPE + substantial STA rewards** |

**Even without considering the monetary value of STA**, Alice achieved an **18.8% return on her capital in one year.&#32;**And **if STA appreciates** (due to demand, buyback and burn, HYPE rewards), her **total return becomes even higher.**

## 3 - The STA token: capture the value of the Statera protocol

At Statera, our token is **not just a utility token**—it is **deeply integrated into the ecosystem and our strategies**. From day one, we designed its allocation, utility, and economic role to **create and redistribute value** to those who believe in our vision.

The STA token is built to capture the growth generated by the strategies and platform activity

**Holding STA means owning a stake in the future we’re building**—a simpler, more efficient, and universally accessible Web3.

### 3a - Protocol Governance

It’s no secret: many decentralized protocols promise governance utility for their tokens, only to leave users disappointed.

With Statera, there are **no empty promises**—only **real, meaningful participation** for STA holders in the protocol’s technical and strategic decisions.

Statera’s roadmap includes the launch of a **fully-fledged DAO**, enabling STA holders to:

- **Propose or vote** to add new indices
- **Modify parameters** of existing indices (rebalancing frequency, adding/removing assets, adjusting weights)
- **Adjust the protocol’s revenue allocation strategy**

Governance will be **transparent, decentralized, and driven by the community**—ensuring that those who contribute the most have the greatest say.

#### **3b - Capturing Growth – Revenue Distribution**

At Statera, we believe a decentralized protocol must **first serve its community**. That’s why we’ve built an **innovative, transparent economic model** designed to **directly return value** to the people who power the ecosystem: **STA holders**.

Every transaction on Statera generates fees.

When a user deposits HYPE into a strategy, an **entry fee of 0.5%** is charged in HYPE. This means 0.5% of the deposited amount is taken as a fee, and the remaining 99.5% is used to calculate the user’s initial investment NAV.

- *Example*: If a user deposits 1 HYPE, **0.005 HYPE** is taken as fee, and the NAV of his investment starts at **0.995 HYPE**.

When a user withdraws from a strategy, an **exit fee of 0.5%** is applied to the amount withdrawn. The fee is deducted at withdrawal, in HYPE.

- *Example*: If the user’s investment has grown to a NAV of 2 HYPE and he decide to withdraw everything, he receives **1.99 HYPE**, and **0.01 HYPE** is taken as exit fee.

Additionally, a **management fee of 0.95% per year** is charged on the total capital invested in the strategy. This fee is deducted periodically directly from the strategy pool, reducing the overall NAV for all investors over time. It applies to all participants and is included in the reported NAV.

These fees fund the dual redistribution mechanism : 

Unlike centralized models where revenues benefit a few insiders, **100% of fees go back to STA holders**:

- **50% → Direct redistribution**
- **50% → Buyback & Burn**

Statera does **not extract value for centralized stakeholders**. Instead, it **redistributes value fairly, predictably, and automatically**—a model that embodies our vision of a **sustainable, community-driven, and economically resilient protocol**, where every participant benefits from Statera’s success.

##### **Direct Redistribution**

50% of all protocol fees are deposited into a **dedicated vault**, fully controlled by **audited smart contracts**. This vault powers a **continuous stream of automatic distributions** to STA holders who **deposit their tokens into the STA Staking Vault&#32;**— demonstrating long-term commitment to the protocol.

The STA Staking Vault allows users to deposit their STA and receive, as rewards, 50% of the **HYPE collected by the protocol**, distributed proportionally based on vault's share.

This means every user who supports Statera earns a **real, passive income**, directly tied to the protocol’s activity and growth.

This mechanism creates a **virtuous cycle**:
✅ The more activity on Statera → the higher the fees collected → the greater the value returned to STA Staking Vault depositors.
✅ STA holders are incentivized to deposit on STA Staking Vault, increasing protocol stability and community engagement


**Buyback & Burn**

We’ve designed a **simple but powerful mechanism** to support long-term token value and deliver direct impact to our community.

🔹 **Every day, 50% of collected fees are used to buy back STA tokens from the market and burn them permanently.**

This process:

- **Reduces circulating supply**, naturally and steadily supporting STA’s value
- **Indirectly benefits indices containing STA**, increasing their exposure over time
- **Offsets inflation**, protecting long-term holders

The more platform activity grows, the stronger the **Buyback & Burn** mechanism becomes—acting as an **engine of scarcity and appreciation** for STA.

Visuel : 

User pays fee (HYPE)

--> 50% buy STA and burn / 50% distributed to STA depositors in STA Staking Vault

#### **3c - Managing Inflation**

The STA token is designed to **grow with the ecosystem** and **reward those who sustain the protocol**. That’s why we’ve fixed an initial inflation at 10% per year, not as a cost—but as a **value engine**. Future adjustments will be governed by STA holders.

🔹 **In practice:**

- **100% of inflation is distributed** to Statera users depositing their ERA token in the **ERA Staking Vault**, reinforcing their long-term commitment
- It **increases the value of indices over time**, offering additional rewards to engaged investors
- It **drives adoption** of Statera's products, creating a **virtuous cycle** where activity fuels greater community rewards

With Statera, **inflation is not dilution**—it is a **lever for growth and value-sharing**.

#### **3d - Tokenomics**

Convinced by the performance and value created by our products, and guided by **decentralization as our ethical compass**, we’ve made a radical choice : **100% of protocol revenue is redistributed to the community.**

By rewarding engagement, support, and participation, Statera turns every user into a **true co-owner of the protocol’s future.**

Our tokenomics reflect this vision:

- **No internal profit capture**
- **No privileged allocations**

Value flows exactly where it should—into the hands of those who **use, support, and believe in Statera**.
A model that is **fair, transparent, and deeply community-driven.**

**Supply and Inflation: Balancing Growth and Value**

- **Initial total supply**: 100,000,000 STA
- **Emission model**: 10% annual inflation, issued continuously to fund long-term rewards
- **Deflationary offset**: 50% of protocol revenue used to **buy back and burn STA**, creating **programmed scarcity**

→ Over time, if protocol activity grows, **deflationary pressure can exceed inflation**, making AXN **net deflationary**.

This model ensures **long-term sustainability** while protecting token value from excessive dilution.

**Distribution: Fair, Community-First, No Privileges**

All STA supply will be distributed at launch across two equitable channels:

| Allocation | Percentage | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Community Rewards** | 50% | Distributed via a **points-based system** during Phase 0, based on participation in strategies |
| **Liquidity Mining** | 50% | Rewards for users providing liquidity into the **Ignition Core**, funding the primary pool at TGE (see below) |

❗ **No tokens were allocated to the team, investors, or partners**—Statera is built on a **truly fair and decentralized distribution.**

#### **3e - Liquidity Mining: Rewarding Early Engagement**

Statera’s **liquidity mining** mechanism is designed to **fairly reward early liquidity contributors**, with **no centralized allocations or privileged access.**

Before the **TGE (Token Generation Event)**, users can deposit HYPE into a **the LP vault.**

Key features:

- **Flexible deposits**: Funds can be withdrawn at any time **before the lock period**
- **No rewards are credited** until the vault is locked
- **Global cap of $5M equivalent** to limit risk and ensure balanced distribution

**Locking :**
A few days or weeks before TGE, the LP vault is **locked**:

- Withdrawals become **impossible**
- New deposits remain **allowed** until the $5M cap is reached (if not before)
- **Point distribution** is finalized based on each user’s share **the day before TGE**—no further capital additions after that.

**At TGE:**
50M STA (50% of the initial supply) are minted and transferred to the LP vault, which now forms a balanced 50/50 liquidity pool:

- **50M STA**
- **125,000 HYPE** (from user deposits)

Each contributor have an allocation of **STAlp**, a liquidity token representing their proportional share of the pool, **linearly vested on 12 months**. 

The value of 1 STAlp is set at launch to **0.0025 HYPE + 1 STA**, reflecting the initial price ratio (1 STA = 0.0025 HYPE). After TGE, the **market price of STA floats freely** based on trading activity. 

Users can **burn&#32;STAlp&#32;at any time** to withdraw their underlying assets at this ratio — effectively "tapping" the battery they helped charge.

After TGE, new users can join the Statera's LP vault by depositing **balanced liquidity**, proportional to the **current market value of STA**. However, only early contributors who deposited before TGE benefit from the **asymmetric entry** — depositing HYPE alone while gaining exposure to STA.

**The Statera's LP vault is not just a launch mechanism — it’s a lasting engine of value.**
Users can deposit their **STAlp tokens into a STAlp Staking vault** to earn a share of the **10% annual STA inflation**. Rewards are distributed based on each user’s deposited value. Crucially, **holders of STAlp are guaranteed at least 20% of the yearly inflation rewards**, regardless of their relative share — a lasting incentive for those who fuel the Statera liquidity pool.

This ensures **long-term liquidity depth** and rewards those who helped launch the protocol.

Example : 

#### 🚀 Initial State – At TGE

- **LP vault composition**: 50,000,000 STA (50% of initial supply) - 125,000 HYPE (from pre-TGE deposits)
- **Initial STA price**: 0.10 USDC --> 0.0025 HYPE
- **Total supply of STAlp minted**: 50,000,000
→ Each **1 STAlp = 0.0025 HYPE + 1 STA** (initial accounting value)

🔹 **User A (Early Contributor)**

- Deposited: 250 HYPE before TGE
- Received: 100,000 STAlp (250/0.0025)
- Did not redeem → instead, deposits **100,000 STAlp into the LP Staking Vault**
- Participates in inflation rewards

***

### 📅 Phase 1 – Month 1 (Post-TGE)

#### 📈 Market Activity

- High demand → STA trades up to 0.004 HYPE (+60%)
- **New Statera LP reserves (approx)**:
- 45,000,000 STA
- 180,000 HYPE
- **Total supply of STAlp minted**: 50,000,000
→ Each **1 STAlp = 0.0036 HYPE + 0.9 STA** (new accounting value)

#### New Deposit – User B (Post-TGE Contributor)

- Wants to mint 100,000 STAlp
- Must deposit **market-balanced liquidity**: 360 HYPE + 90'000 STA
- Receives: 100,000 STAlp
- **Total supply of STAlp minted**: 50,100,000
→ Each **1 STAlp = 0.0036 HYPE + 0.9 STA**
- Immediately deposits them into the **LP Staking Vault**

#### LP Staking Vault – Monthly Inflation Distribution

- **Monthly inflation (1/12 of 10%)**: 833,333.333 STA
- **Total deposits in LP Staking Vault**: 
    - User A: 100,000 axLPBATT
→ Valued at: 100,000 × (0.16 + 1 × 0.167) = **32,032 USDC** 
    - User B: 100,000 axLPBATT
→ Valued at: 32,032**&#32;USDC** 
    - Other users (ax[INDEX] depositors) : 3,600,000 USDC 
- **Total Reactor value**: 3,664,064 USDC
- **Pro-rata share without floor**: 
    - axLPBATT depositors: 64,064 / 3,664,064 = **1.75%** --> 4,375 AXN
    - ax[INDEX] depositors: **98.25% -->&#32;**245,625 AXN
- **But**: axLPBATT derpositors are **guaranteed at least 20% of inflation&#32;**→ **50,000 AXN**
- Split equally:
    - User A: **25,000 AXN** 
    - User B: **25,000 AXN**
    - Remaining 200,000 AXN → distributed to ax[INDEX] depositors
