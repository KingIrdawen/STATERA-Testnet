            Unlike a static basket of assets, a Statera index is powered by <strong>smart contracts</strong> that automatically adjust its composition to maintain its target allocation—e.g., 50% BTC / 50% HYPE.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Holding crypto long-term (spot) has long been a profitable strategy—who wouldn&apos;t dream, in 2025, of shouting back to their 2013 self: &quot;Just buy Bitcoin!&quot;?
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            But markets have matured. The era of easy gains is over. Institutions have entered the game.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4 font-semibold">
            Today, <strong>passive holding is no longer enough. You must act intelligently.</strong>
          </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-8"><span className="text-[#C9A36A]">How It Works</span></h2>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Cryptocurrencies are volatile. In Statera indices, this leads to weight imbalances:
          </p>
          <ul className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4 ml-6 space-y-2">
            <li>When an asset rises, it becomes <strong>overweighted</strong>.</li>
            <li>When another falls, it becomes <strong>underweighted</strong>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong>Smart rebalancing</strong> automatically adjusts the portfolio:
          </p>
          <ul className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4 ml-6 space-y-2">
            <li>→ The rebalancing smart contract sells part of the appreciated asset</li>
            <li>→ Then buys more of the underperforming one</li>
            <li>→ Fees are payed with users funds on this index.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            This ensures consistent exposure to your chosen assets.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Statera indices perform <strong>hourly checks</strong> on their portfolio composition, but rebalancing is <strong>not executed automatically every hour</strong>—it is <strong>triggered only when an asset&apos;s weight deviates significantly from its target</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The <strong>deviation threshold</strong> required to initiate a rebalance (e.g., ±0.1% for our first strategy) is <strong>not fixed across all indices</strong>—it is <strong>customized based on the index&apos;s strategy, defined by asset volatility and risk profile</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            For example:
          </p>
          <ul className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4 ml-6 space-y-2">
            <li>A <strong>low-volatility index</strong> might use a tight threshold (e.g., ±0.1%) to maintain precise exposure.</li>
            <li>A <strong>high-volatility or momentum-focused index</strong> might use a wider threshold (e.g., ±0.5-1%) to avoid over-trading and capture stronger trends.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            This dynamic approach ensures that rebalancing occurs <strong>only when meaningful</strong>, reducing unnecessary operations, minimizing costs, and improving net performance. If the portfolio remains within the defined tolerance band after an hourly check, no action is taken—preserving efficiency while maintaining strategic discipline.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            By combining <strong>hourly monitoring</strong> with <strong>index-specific thresholds</strong>, Statera delivers a <strong>smarter, more adaptive form of active management</strong>—fully automated, transparent, and optimized for each strategy.
          </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-8"><span className="text-[#C9A36A]">Example: Statera&apos;s first index ERA1 (50% BTC / 50% HYPE)</span></h2>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            After a strong rally in Bitcoin, the portfolio&apos;s composition shifts to:
          </p>
          <ul className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4 ml-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>BTC: 50.5%</strong></li>
            <li><strong>HYPE: 49.5%</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The <strong>target allocation</strong> is 50/50, and the <strong>rebalancing threshold is set at ±0.1%</strong>. Since BTC is now <strong>0.4 percentage points above</strong> its target (well beyond the 0.1% threshold), the <strong>smart rebalancing mechanism is triggered</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The smart contract automatically:
          </p>
          <ul className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4 ml-6 space-y-2">
            <li>→ Sells a portion of BTC</li>
            <li>→ Buys HYPE</li>
            <li>→ Returns the portfolio to <strong>50% BTC / 50% HYPE</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            🔁 <strong>Result</strong>: You&apos;ve <strong>sold high and bought low</strong>—without any action on your part. The system only acted because the deviation was significant, ensuring <strong>smart, efficient, and cost-effective rebalancing</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed">
            This mechanism lets you <strong>benefit from volatility</strong> while avoiding unnecessary trades on minor price noise.

          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            A non-rebalanced portfolio drifts with the market: if BTC surges, you become <strong>overexposed to BTC risk</strong>. A correction can lead to massive losses.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Smart rebalancing <strong>maintains stable allocation</strong>, reducing the risk of overconcentration. In volatile or sideways markets, a rebalanced index <strong>often outperforms simple holding.</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed">
            Smart rebalancing doesn&apos;t guarantee outperformance in all market conditions. In strong bull runs, selling early may limit maximum gains. But in return, you <strong>reduce risk, diversify intelligently, and capitalize on volatility</strong>—a more <strong>robust long-term approach.</strong>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6"><span className="text-[#C9A36A]">Rebalancing in Traditional Finance</span></h2>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Rebalancing is a well-established pillar of portfolio management. Decades of academic research and institutional practice, including studies by <strong>Vanguard, Morningstar</strong> and others, consistently show that regularly returning a portfolio to its target mix improves <strong>risk-adjusted returns</strong>, captures a <strong>&quot;buy low, sell high&quot; effect</strong>, and avoids unwanted risk drift.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            On average, annual or threshold-based rebalancing (±5%) delivers a <strong>performance boost of 0.3% to 0.5% per year</strong>, while reducing volatility.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            However, these same studies warn against <strong>excessively frequent rebalancing</strong> (monthly or weekly), due to <strong>transaction costs, spreads, and operational friction</strong>. In traditional finance, marginal costs quickly accumulate, eroding net performance. That&apos;s why conventional wisdom recommends moderate frequency: <strong>not too rare to maintain discipline, not too frequent to avoid overtrading.</strong>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6"><span className="text-[#C9A36A]">Rebalancing in DeFi</span></h2>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Rebalancing isn&apos;t just a good idea—it&apos;s a <strong>strategy validated by decades of financial analysis.</strong> It improves risk-return profiles, enforces discipline, and harnesses volatility.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            In theory, <strong>DeFi should take rebalancing further</strong>: automation, higher frequency, transparency.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Yet in practice, <strong>most DeFi protocols face the same limitation as TradFi: costs.</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            On AMM-based DEXs (Automated Market Makers), each rebalancing incurs:
          </p>
          <ul className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4 ml-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>High swap fees</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Significant slippage</strong>, especially on large amounts</li>
            <li><strong>Fragmented liquidity</strong>, vulnerable to manipulation</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Like TradFi, frequency quickly becomes <strong>a source of friction, not performance.</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed">
            The promise of active, frequent rebalancing <strong>remains unfulfilled</strong>—not due to flawed strategy, but <strong>because of infrastructure limits.</strong>
